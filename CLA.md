# Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to losp. In order to clarify the
intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or
entity, the project maintainer must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the
license terms below.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and
future Contributions submitted to the project. Except for the license granted
herein to the project maintainer and recipients of software distributed by the
project maintainer, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your
Contributions.

## Definitions

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by
the copyright owner that is making this Agreement. For legal entities, the
entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled
by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single
Contributor.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted
by You to the project for inclusion in, or documentation of, the project. For
the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic or
written communication sent to the project or its representatives, including but
not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
project for the purpose of discussing and improving the project, but excluding
communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by
You as "Not a Contribution."

## Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
Nicholas R. Perez (the "Project Maintainer") and to recipients of software
distributed by the Project Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
Project Maintainer and to recipients of software distributed by the Project
Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
and otherwise transfer Your Contributions, where such license applies only to
those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the project
to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

## Representations

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your
employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes
Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make
Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such
rights for Your Contributions to the project, or that Your employer has executed
a separate Corporate CLA with the Project Maintainer.

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You
represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any
third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related
patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are
associated with any part of Your Contributions.

## No Obligation

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the
extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a
fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
